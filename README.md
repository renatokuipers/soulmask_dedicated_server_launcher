This is my first attempt at creating a Soulmask Dedicated Server Launcher.

Download the .exe file, put it in your server folder Where also the .bat file is, and run it.
After running you can set your Servername, the amount of players, a password for the server and a admin password and then press "Start Server".

See the magic happen.
