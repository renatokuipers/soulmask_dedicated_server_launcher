This is my first attempt at creating a Soulmask Dedicated Server Launcher.
This is just a first concept.

This launcher will check if you have the serverfiles installed on the C: drive (assuming that you downloaded it with the steamCMD.exe)
If not, this application will download and install the Serverfiles.
Then, in the GUI, you will be able to adjust the config files and the ini file (these are very obvious in the GUI)

PS:
For now you can't start the server or do anything else, but I will update this soon.

PPS:
There is no .exe file for this Application YET. I will create this soon!
